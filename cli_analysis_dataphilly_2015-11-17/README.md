This presentation was given on November 17th, 2015 at the Philadelphia Media Network office at 801 Market St.

I received a few comments on this talk that I would like to address here:

1.  "Do you even xargs?"  Yes, I use a lot of things that are not included in this presentation.  It is one of the things I cut out to fit this into 30 minutes.
2.  "You know, you don't have to cat things to grep/awk/etc.  (i.e., there are other ways to do this)"  Yeah, I know.  In real life, I build up compound commands by adding new things to the end of the pipeline.  Feel free to do it your own way.
